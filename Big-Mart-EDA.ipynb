    "+ Are: Stores located in urban or Tier 1 cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.\n",
    "+ Stores located in densely populated areas should have higher sales because of more demand.\n",
    "+ Stores located within popular marketplaces should have higher sales because of better access to customers.\n",
    "+ Established stores often enjoy higher sales compared to newer ones because customers tend to trust and purchase from familiar vendors.\n",
    "+ Products which are given bigger shelves in the store are likely to catch attention first and sell more.\n",
    "+ The location of product in a store will impact sales. Ones which are right at entrance will catch the eye of customer first rather than the ones in back.\n",
